Next, it creates a ServerSocket, prints out the port number used, and listens on the
socket for new connection (i.e. the accept method). When a new connection from
another user arrives, the connection Socket is established. The main thread will become
the so-called reading thread by listening to the connection socket. (Here, it resembles
the server code of project 1, instead of project 2). This thread will attempt to read
messages from the connection socket and print the messages on the screen. If the
message is “transfer filename”, it reads the file and stores locally.
