First, it creates a new thread – let’s call it the writing thread. Refer to the server code of
project 2 for how to create a new thread with new Handler(...).start(). This thread will
take a port number from the keyboard and then connects to that port number. After the
connection (socket) is successfully established, it goes into a loop of reading a message
from the keyboard and writing the message to the connection (socket). If the message
is ”transfer filename”, after the message is written, the file is transmitted through the
connection.
